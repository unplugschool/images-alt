# 🧭 Guide

-

- Focus on describing FUNCTION or CONTENT
- All images must have an alt attribute (even if empty)
- Context is key when describing images

-

## (1) Is this image interactive?

- It's a *functional* image
- Describe the action or result

-

![Example of image as logo](img/functional1.png)

-

![Example of image as print icon](img/functional2.png)

-

## (2) Does this image include content?

- It's an *informative* image
- Describe the meaning and purpose
- Avoid literal descriptions
- No need to start with "Picture..." or "Photo..."
- Surrounding context might be enough

-

-

-

## (3) No function and no content?

- It's is a *decorative* image
- Don't provide alt text: `<img alt="">`
- Screen readers will skip completely

-
