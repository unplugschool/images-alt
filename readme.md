# 👍🏻 How to write good alt text

-

- Focus on describing FUNCTION or CONTENT
- All images must have an alt attribute (even if empty)
- Context is key when describing images

-

## (1) Is this image interactive?

- It's a *functional* image
- Describe the action to be taken
- Use action phrasing

-

## (2) Does this image include content?

- It's an *informative* image
- Describe the meaning and purpose
- Avoid literal descriptions
- No need to start with "Picture..." or "Photo..."

-

## (3) No function and no content?

- It's is a *decorative* image
- Leave `alt` empty
- Screen readers will skip completely

---

# ✨ Extras

- Images of text (please don't)
- Complex images (charts, graphs)
- Groups of images (star ratings, other widgets)
- Image maps
